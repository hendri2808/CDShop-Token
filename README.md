2. **Transaction**: Once users hold CDST tokens, they can use them to purchase digital products available on the CDShop platform. Transactions are executed through the smart contract, ensuring transparency and security.

3. **Community Governance**: Depending on the governance model implemented by CDShop, token holders may have voting rights to participate in decision-making processes regarding the future development and direction of the platform.
